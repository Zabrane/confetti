%% Algorithm: "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations"
%% by E. Myers, 1986.
%%
%% Some good info can also be found at http://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/
%%
%% General principle of the algorithm:
%%
%% We are about to produce a diff (or editscript) on what differs (or
%% how to get from) string Sx to Sy.  We lay out a grid with the
%% symbols from Sx on the x-axis and the symbols from Sy on the Y
%% axis. The first symbol of Sx and Sy is at (0,0).
%%
%% (The Sx and Sy are strings of symbols: lists of lines or lists of
%% characters, or lists of works, or whatever is suitable.)
%%
%% Example: Sx="aXcccXe", Sy="aYcccYe" ==> the following grid is formed:
%%
%%             Sx
%%             aXcccXe
%%         Sy a\
%%            Y
%%            c  \\\
%%            c  \\\
%%            c  \\\
%%            Y
%%            e      \
%%
%% Our plan now is go from corner to corner: from (0,0) to (7,7).
%% We can move diagonally whenever the character on the x-axis and the
%% character on the y-axis are identical. Those are symbolized by the
%% \-edges in the grid above.
%%
%% When it is not possible to go diagonally (because the characters on
%% the x- and y-axis are not identicl), we have to go horizontally
%% and vertically. This corresponds to deleting characters from Sx and
%% inserting characters from Sy.
%%
%% Definitions (from the "O(ND) ..." paper by E.Myers):
%%
%% * A D-path is a path with D non-diagonal edges (ie: edges that are
%%   vertical and/or horizontal).
%% * K-diagonal: the diagonal such that K=X-Y
%%   (Thus, the 0-diagonal is the one starting at (0,0), going
%%   straight down-right. The 1-diagonal is the one just to the right of
%%   the 0-diagonal: starting at (1,0) going straight down-right.
%%   There are negative diagonals as well: the -1-diagonal is the one starting
%%   at (0,1), and so on.
%% * Snake: a sequence of only-diagonal steps
%%
%% The algorithm loops over D and over the K-diagonals:
%% D = 0..(length(Sx)+length(Sy))
%%   K = -D..D in steps of 2
%%     For every such K-diagonal, we choose between the (D-1)-paths
%%     whose end-points are currently on the adjacent (K-1)- and
%%     (K+1)-diagonals: we pick the one that have gone furthest along
%%     its diagonal.
%%
%%     This means taking that (D-1)-path and going right (if
%%     we pick the (D-1)-path on the (K-1)-diagonal) or down (if we
%%     pick the (D-1)-path on the (K+1)-diagonal), thus forming a
%%     D-path from a (D-1)-path.
%%
%%     After this, we try to extend the snake as far as possible along
%%     the K-diagonal.
%%
%%     Note that this means that when we choose between the
%%     (D-1)-paths along the (K-1)- and (K+1)-diagonals, we choose
%%     between two paths, whose snakes have been extended as far as
%%     possible, ie: they are at a point where the characters Sx and
%%     Sy don't match.
%%
%% Note that with this algorithm, we always do comparions further
%% right into the strings Sx and Sy. The algorithm never goes towards
%% the beginning of either Sx or Sy do do further comparisons. This is
%% good, because this fits the way lists are built in functional
%% programming languages.
